## How to mine Raptoreum (RTM) on Akash Network

# Why use Akash?

Welcome [Raptoreum](https://raptoreum.com/) miners! [Akash](https://akash.network) is a decentralized marketplace of compute with thousands of CPU's ready for small and large deployments.  Raptoreum mining can be deployed on the network successfully using this guide.  Akash is a part of the [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/) ecosystem of blockchains.

# Windows and Mac Users 

1. [Follow our Quick Start Guide](https://docs.akash.network/guides/deploy)
2. Edit the deploy.yaml file with your wallet address.
3. Deploy and manage your deployments with [Akashlytics](https://akashlytics.com/deploy)

# Linux Users 

1.  Follow our [Bootstrap Start Guide](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash-wallet-handler)
2.  Edit the deploy.yaml file with your wallet address.
3.  Deploy and manage your deployments with [Akashlytics](https://akashlytics.com/deploy)

# How does this work?
Akash uses its blockchain to manage your container deployment and accounting.  To deploy on Akash you will need to fund your wallet with at least 10 AKT (~$20)  Each time you create a deployment, 5 AKT will be used for escrow and to fund the deployment.  If the deployment is cancelled the balance of the escrow is returned to you.  You can spin up deployments without worrying about any long term contracts and you can cancel anytime. 

# Default wallet
Akash uses [Keplr](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap?hl=en) as the desktop wallet.  Advanced users can follow the [CLI instructions](https://docs.akash.network/guides/cli)

# Quickest way to get more AKT
To fund your deployment you will need AKT in your account.  The fastest way to do that is as follows:

## Buy on an Exchange
1. Install [Keplr](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap?hl=en)
2. Buy AKT on an [exchange](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/akash-network#markets) 
3. Withdraw your AKT to your Keplr wallet.

## Swap from `ATOM` to `AKT`
1. Install [Keplr](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap?hl=en)
2. Send 10 ATOM to your new Cosmos wallet address (this address will start with `cosmos`)
3. Goto https://app.osmosis.zone/assets > next to `Cosmos Hub - ATOM` click on `Deposit`
4. Now go back to https://app.osmosis.zone/ and select `ATOM > AKT` to complete the swap
5. Return to the https://app.osmosis.zone/assets page to withdraw your AKT to your Keplr wallet

# Choosing a provider

Akash is a marketplace of compute.  Providers set their own prices for compute resources.  We recommend you try different providers and check your logs after deployment to determine the hashrate.

# How to speed up mining?

## Change the tuning option

`TUNE=no-tune` variable in deploy.yaml to `TUNE=full-tune`

No tune will start mining right away - with no performance tuning of the container.  Without this expect a lower hashrate.
Be warned, tuning can take at least 3 hours before mining begins - so do not expect to see hashrate on the pool immediately.
You can always check your logs in Akashlytics.

## Increase the deployment size on Akash

You can deploy more CPU or more replicas to mine faster.


```
cpu:
  units: 1.0 # Max cpu units is 10

```

Or increase the replica count from `count: 1` to `count: 2`.

```
deployment:
  raptoreum:
    akash:
      profile: raptoreum
      count: 1 # Multiplier for cpu:units
```

# Check your profitability

After your deployment has finished tuning or is displaying results on the pool you can check your profitability by inputing your hashrate from the log file.
